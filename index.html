    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the accrued interest<br> 
    What is the accrued interest?<br>
    The accrued interest is the interest that has been incurred as of a specific date on a loan or any other liability that isnot paid yet.
    How to calculate accrued interest?<br>
    To calculate accrued interest you should use the following formula:<br>
    accrued interest = loan amount * (yearly interest / 365) * accrued interest period<br>
    example: company x took a loan and the amount of the loan was $13,500, yearly interest was 12% and the accrued interest period was 90 days, calculate the accrued interest?<br>
    Using the accrued interest formula the answer will be:<br>
    accrued interest = loan amount * (yearly interest / 365) * accrued interest period<br>
    accrued interest = $13,500 * (0.12 / 365) * 90<br>
    accrued interest = $399.45<br>
    Why use accrued interest?<br>
    the accrued interest is used to account for the interest that has accrued over a period of time without being paid yet.
